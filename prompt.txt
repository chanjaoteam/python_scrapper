merchant	VARCHAR(255)	Merchant or seller of the product.
weight	VARCHAR(100)	Weight of the product (if applicable).
description	TEXT	Description of the product.
category_id	INT	Foreign key linking to the categories table.
raw_html_path	VARCHAR(255)	Path to the raw HTML file of the product detail page.
created_at	DATETIME	Timestamp of when the product was scraped.
updated_at	DATETIME	Timestamp of the last update to the product entry.
2. Categories Table
This table will store the product categories for better organization.

Column Name	Data Type	Description
id	INT PRIMARY KEY	Unique identifier for each category.

Products Table has a foreign key relationship with Categories Table through category_id, allowing you to categorize products effectively.
The Raw HTML Table can optionally link to the Products Table if you want to maintain a record of all raw HTML associated with each product.
SQL Example for Creating Tables
Here’s an example of how you can create these tables using SQL:

sql
Copy code
CREATE TABLE categories (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    parent_id INT DEFAULT NULL,
    created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE products (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    price DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL,
    merchant VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    weight VARCHAR(100),
    description TEXT,
    category_id INT,
    raw_html_path VARCHAR(255),
    created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (category_id) REFERENCES categories(id)
);

CREATE TABLE raw_html (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    file_path VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    type ENUM('product_list', 'product_detail') NOT NULL,
    created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
Summary
This database structure is designed to support efficient data management for your TaobaoScraper. It ensures that product information is well-organized and easily accessible, allowing for future expansions like adding more product attributes or categories.
